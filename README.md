# operating-systems-s16

This repository contains my solutions to the labs from Allan Gottlieb's 
Operating Systems class.

There is admittedly a fair amount of duct tape in the code because it 
seemed like the primary task of the labs was to match pre-specified output

If you are taking CS202 at NYU, be mindful that viewing or referencing
this code is likely in violation of the honor code that was specified by
your professor, so don't do it.
